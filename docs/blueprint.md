# **App Name**: Sakura Studio

## Core Features:

- Configurable Parameters: Configuration driven UI: The application's behavior (API endpoints, directory locations, image paths, prompts) are configurable via settings, rather than being hardcoded.
- Avatar Generation: Allow users to upload or capture photos and transform them into stylized avatars. The AI tool generates background prompts based on user selected parameters. It uses reasoning to decide which object, location, movie, or fantasy category to include in the prompt.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft cherry blossom pink (#FFB7C5) for a gentle and inviting feel.
- Secondary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral background.
- Accent: Teal (#4DB6AC) for interactive elements to add a touch of vibrancy.
- Use a clean, minimalist layout to focus user attention on the image generation process.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like a gentle fade-in for newly generated images, to enhance the user experience.
- Use simple, outlined icons for navigation and options to maintain a clean aesthetic.
